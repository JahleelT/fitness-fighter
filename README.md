# Project: Fitness Fighter 

## Overview

- **Fitness Fighter** is a versatile web app that functions as a fitness tracker that will eventually add some gameification features such as a tap-action game. Until then, the focus is to get the basic structure of a CRUD app established before adding any social or gaming features. The focus at the start will be calisthenics and eventually other styles of exercise will be added. The exercises are comprehensively organized using a cross-referencing system. The goal is to bring a little bit of fun to tracking your fitness.
